This provides auto-completion-mode support for R.

It will be unmaintained soon.  See the comment from the ESS developer.

NOTE: an improved version of this ac-sources is now part of ESS SVN and will
be released with next v5.16. Please don't use this file if you use new
version of ESS, or it might have unpredictable consequences. 
Send a mail to ess-help for support.
